        Yourney is a premium car rental application that showcases my frontend
        development skills using modern React technologies.
      </p>
      <p className="fs-6">
        The application features a clean, responsive design built with Bootstrap
        and Sass, while using Zustand for efficient state management.

        I implemented user authentication flows including registration and login
        pages, demonstrating my understanding of form handling and client-side
        validation. The authentication data is stored in local storage,
        simulating how a real application would handle user sessions.
      </p>
      <p className="fs-6">
        The booking flow allows users to browse available vehicles, select
        rental dates, and choose pickup/drop-off locations. The user profile
        section enables customers to update their profile information (username,
        first name, email address) and profile photo, as well as reset their
        password. Users can manage their active bookings through a simple
        dashboard interface.

        This project helped me gain hands-on experience with React development,
        state management, and frontend best practices while creating a
        functional demo that showcases these skills.
